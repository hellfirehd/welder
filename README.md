# Welder

A reimplementation of the [DragonBurner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner) toolhead. It is designed to replace the stock extruder and hotend on Creality Ender 5 and Sovol SV05 series of 3D printers, or really, any printers that use V-WHeels on 2020 aluminum extrusions.
